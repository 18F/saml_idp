# Ruby SAML Identity Provider (IdP)
Forked from https://github.com/sportngin/saml_idp

The ruby SAML Identity Provider library is for implementing the server side of SAML authentication. It allows
your application to act as an IdP (Identity Provider) using the
[SAML v2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
protocol. It provides a means for managing authentication requests and confirmation responses for SPs (Service Providers).

:information_source: We have forked this gem in order to develop an ICAM solution leveraging Ruby SAML. We are working towards distilling our enhancements and offering more suport to the community-backed gems. To get involved with the community development of Ruby SAML or SAML IdP please visit their GitHub repositories.
